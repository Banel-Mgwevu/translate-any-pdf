YOU SAW THIS ERROR:
==================
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\document_translator.py", line 24, in <module>
    from ooxml.document import Document
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ooxml'


WHAT THIS MEANS:
================
The 'ooxml' folder is missing from your directory. This folder contains
essential code that the translator needs to work.


THE PROBLEM:
============
When you downloaded/extracted the files, you got the .py files but NOT
the ooxml/ and scripts/ folders. Without these folders, nothing will work.


THE SOLUTION:
=============

STEP 1: Check What You Have
----------------------------
Open your folder in File Explorer:
C:\Users\X\Desktop\translator_ai\files\

You should see:
✓ ooxml\ (folder)           ← Is this there?
✓ scripts\ (folder)         ← Is this there?
✓ document_translator.py
✓ document_translator_gui.py
✓ Other .py and .md files

If ooxml\ or scripts\ folders are MISSING, continue to Step 2.


STEP 2: Get the Missing Folders
--------------------------------

Option A - Quick Check (Recommended):
   1. Run this in PowerShell/Command Prompt:
      check_setup.bat
   
   2. It will tell you exactly what's missing

Option B - Manual Fix:
   You need to re-download the COMPLETE package that includes:
   - All .py files
   - The ooxml/ folder (with __init__.py, document.py, xmleditor.py)
   - The scripts/ folder (with pack.py, unpack.py)
   
   Make sure when extracting:
   - Extract ALL files
   - Don't just copy individual files
   - Folders must be preserved


STEP 3: Verify the Fix
-----------------------
After getting the folders, run:

PowerShell:
   python fix_setup.py

This will check everything and tell you if it's correct.


STEP 4: Try Again
-----------------
Once fix_setup.py says everything is OK, try:

   python document_translator.py sample_document.docx output.docx es

Or use the GUI:
   python document_translator_gui.py


QUICK VERIFICATION:
===================

Run these commands in order:

1. dir ooxml
   Should show: __init__.py, document.py, xmleditor.py
   
2. dir scripts  
   Should show: pack.py, unpack.py
   
3. python fix_setup.py
   Should say: "ALL REQUIRED FILES FOUND!"


IF FOLDERS ARE STILL MISSING:
==============================

The ooxml and scripts folders contain the actual translation engine.
Without them, only the "wrapper" code exists.

You must obtain these folders from the complete download package.

Where to find them:
- They should be in the same download/package as the .py files
- If you only have .py files, you don't have the complete package
- Re-download from the source where you got the files


YOUR CURRENT SITUATION:
=======================

Based on your error, you have:
✓ document_translator.py (the main file)
✓ Python dependencies installed (googletrans, etc.)
✓ Correct Python version

But you're missing:
✗ ooxml/ folder
✗ scripts/ folder

These folders are ESSENTIAL. Get them, and everything will work.


STILL STUCK?
============

1. Run: check_setup.bat
2. Read: WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md (detailed help)
3. Check: FILE_CHECKLIST.txt (list of required files)

The check_setup.bat will give you a clear yes/no on whether you have
everything needed.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Bottom Line:
- You need the ooxml/ and scripts/ folders
- They must be in the same directory as document_translator.py
- Run check_setup.bat to verify
- Once verified, the program will work
